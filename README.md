# Project 2.3: Contact List

### Project Description: 

- A simple contact list app. The main screen shows a list of contacts. Tapping a contact reveals their phone number and an icon to initiate a phone call using an external package.

### Core Technical Requirements:

- Create a Person data model (first name, last name and a list of phones).
- A person can have more than one phone number
- Display contacts in a ListView using a ListTile.
- Use an external package like url_launcher to handle tel: and mailto: schemes.
- Properly add the package to pubspec.yaml and import it.

### Bonus: add more functionalities

- Implement an “edit contact” feature.
- Add a "share" button next to each contact that uses the share_plus package to share the contact's details as plain text.

# Project 1.2: Personal Greeter

## Project Description: 

A simple application where a user can enter their name into a text field. Upon pressing a button, the app displays a personalized greeting message below, demonstrating the most basic form of user input and state change.

## Core Technical Requirements:
- Use of StatefulWidget to manage the displayed greeting message.

- Implementation of a - TextField to capture user input.

- Use of a TextEditingController to read the value from the TextField.

- A Button (ElevatedButton or similar) to trigger the state update.

## Bonus: add more functionality:

- implement an additional field that changes the greet
meaning: instead of “hello” you can write “yo”, and the greeting will change accordingly
